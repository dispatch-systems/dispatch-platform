# CI tooling

One run per change, in the merge queue, on the exact squash commit the queue will push. Every
standard suite runs every time; nothing runs on the PR itself. The one real wall-clock
native timeout sentinel runs separately each week and on manual dispatch through
`.github/workflows/native-timeouts.yml`, which fails if that case is absent or skipped.
`.github/workflows/checks.yml` is the
whole pipeline, and `tooling/ci/checks.ts` runs one of its jobs by name, or locally the whole
suite in sequence:

| Job             | `npm run check:ci -- …`                    | What it proves                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| build           | `build`                                    | The runtime packages: the release backend and the dashboard.                  |
| checks          | `checks`                                   | Source privacy/secrets, types, formatting, bundle budget and dashboard logic. |
| browser ×6      | `browser <n>/6 [spec]`                     | The browser suite against the packaged runtime.                               |
| smoke           | `smoke`                                    | The package starts, signs in and serves, as a release asks.                   |
| benchmark       | `benchmark`                                | The Rust workload budget.                                                     |
| core            | `core`                                     | Rust formatting, lints, default tests and compile-only operator probes.       |
| api             | `api`                                      | The API tests, the Python tooling tests, the npm audit.                       |
| collectors ×5   | `npm run test:browseros -- --shard <name>` | The native collectors with a real browser.                                    |
| rust-advisories |                                            | `cargo audit`.                                                                |
| platform        |                                            | The gate: the one required check.                                             |

The gate passes only when every job passed. It then verifies the package's inventory and
source commit (`ci-verify.py`, which runs `dispatch-host ci verify`) and publishes it as
`dispatch-main-<sha>` for 90 days. The Dev updater installs that build, and a release stamps
its version into it. A manual run of one suite has no gate, so nothing partial is published;
the release tool accepts only runs whose `core` and `platform` jobs succeeded.

When a queue run fails, GitHub removes the PR with a one-line timeline event and nothing that
leads to the run. The Dispatch bot, the `dispatch-systems` GitHub App in its own repository,
keeps one comment per queue entry on the PR: its position, the squash commit, the jobs as
they run, and at the end the merge, the removal's reason, or the failed jobs with their logs
and the first failure's output.

The ruleset expects the `platform` check on a PR head before the queue admits it, so
`queue-admission.yml` reports one on every PR head, usually within a minute. It proves
nothing; the queue's own gate decides, and a PR queued before it passed is dropped as an
invalid merge commit.

`tooling/ci/dispatch-ci` builds as `dispatch-ci` and holds what runs on this machine: the Rust build
cache and compiler fingerprint (`cargo-build.py`), the PR preflight (`npm run pr:prepare`) and
the ship command. `npm run pr:ship -- <number>` reads the PR from GitHub's API every 20
seconds, adds it to the merge queue once its admission check passed and GitHub knows it merges
cleanly, and waits until GitHub merges it, printing the squash commit. A newer push is queued
in its turn. It stops with the reason when the PR conflicts with `main`, is a draft, closes,
leaves the queue unmerged, with GitHub's reason and the failed jobs of its own queue run, or
has not merged after 90 minutes.

Caches: only `main`'s reach every branch, since the queue's branches are deleted after each
run. `caches.yml` refreshes them on every push to `main`: the release backend keyed by its
inputs, the CI and host tools, the assessment fixture, the Playwright browser and the
BrowserOS package. A run's own `tools` job builds what its inputs lack for the jobs that start
later in that run. Launchers use a restored tool only on CI and only from the workspace's own
`.ci-tools` directory; otherwise they build with Cargo.

The repository Cargo config runs `tooling/rustc-remap.py` for dependencies and workspace
crates, giving compiler paths neutral `/dispatch-build/...` prefixes. The wrapper's SHA-256
in `build.rustflags` invalidates Cargo's dependency objects when the policy changes; update
the hash after editing the wrapper. `check:rules` verifies it. Binary-cache schema 4 and the
tool/fixture keys fingerprint the wrapper and config. Only this exact config allows binary
reuse; custom configs, wrappers or overriding Rust flags (including empty and target-specific
environment flags) disable it. Packaging and the
artifact test run `tooling/security/check-build-paths.py` even for a reused executable, and
reject remaining local build paths without printing their contents. The first build after
adopting this policy recompiles dependencies. Compiler diagnostics use the neutral paths too.

Run the tests with:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p dispatch-ci -p dispatch-host
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/tooling -p '*_test.py'
```

`check:rules` runs the source-only Python partition and every dashboard helper test without
compiling Rust. The API job runs those Python modules and the separate real compiler and
installed-manager modules once each. Native collector files run only in their collector
shards, so the API job does not launch them merely to skip their browser cases.
`tests/tooling/test-plan.test.ts` checks complete, disjoint file coverage against the commands
the runners actually use. Real compiler/manager modules are listed under `pythonIntegration`
in `test-plan.json`; the default unittest discovery command above still runs every module.

The native timeout lane can be run with `npm run test:browseros -- --real-timeouts`, or by
dispatching `native-timeouts.yml` with its optional exact `ref`. It selects only the sentinel,
sets both native and real-timeout gates, and requires a passing JUnit case. Normal collector
runs leave real wall-clock waits out. Live Rust operator probes require the explicit
`operator-probes` feature; core CI typechecks them without executing them.

`npm run check:privacy` scans publishable working files, also through `check:rules` before
pushes and the required `checks` job. It downloads the checksum-pinned Gitleaks release in
`tooling/security/gitleaks.json`, checks for private paths, emails and known identifiers,
and requires exact hashes for reviewed binary assets. Findings show locations and rules,
never matched values. The scan excludes private ignored state and does not cover Git history
or external exports; review prose and images manually. Do not broaden policy exceptions to
silence a finding.
