# Onboarding map

`onboarding-map.svg` is the shared Ventura County vector artwork for owner onboarding.
It contains the approved Camarillo–Ventura illustrative route and no geographic labels.

- Change map colors in `../onboarding-map.css`; both themes reuse the same geometry.
- Form layout and responsive density live in `../onboarding.css`; fields live in
  `../DspSetupForm.tsx`. Map loading and desktop eligibility live in `../map-asset.ts`.
- The `region` group uses coordinates spanning x=0…1800, y=-800…1800.
  `OnboardingMap.tsx` frames that group to the viewport.
- Keep this as an independent SVG asset; do not inline it into React or replace it with a bitmap.
- Vite fingerprints it; the build generates Brotli/gzip representations for cached delivery.
- Desktop loads the asset after the invitation selects DSP onboarding and reveals the complete
  composition once ready. Mobile does not request it. Tests cover both behaviors and the transfer budget.
- Named route, station and pulse geometry serves a separate CSS animation layer.
  A round dash makes the moving marker; it follows the same path as the static route.
  Adjust `--map-cycle`, `--map-start-delay` and `--map-echo-spacing` in
  `../onboarding-map.css`; keyframe percentages set the departure/travel/arrival phases.
  Motion starts after the map is ready and is disabled for reduced motion; the form stays still.
