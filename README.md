# Dispatch

Dispatch combines a Rust backend, React dashboard, and an email delivery Worker.
Run commands from the repository root.

Backend domain folders expose their entry points through `mod.rs`. Rust owns punch
interpretation and meal assessment; the dashboard formats typed assessment results. Dashboard features
expose theirs through `index.ts`. Styles live with their owner; `core/shell/frontend/styles.css`
sets the global import order. Shared contracts and tooling never import dashboard code.

Use an isolated worktree branched from `origin/main`, then `npm ci` and `npm run dev`.
The preview prints a private fixture URL. `npm run check:ci` runs full validation;
`npm run check:ci -- checks` runs the dashboard checks against a build. `npm test` discovers
TypeScript tests recursively; Python tooling tests use
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/tooling -p '*_test.py'`.

`npm run contracts:generate` updates the committed TypeScript bindings. Normal Rust
tests verify them without rewriting files. Generated types, schema snapshots and
approved artwork remain with their owners.

The Python entry points at the top of `tooling/` keep their installed and CI paths; the
build cache, PR preflight and ship command delegate to the small `dispatch-ci` executable,
and artifact verification, releases, fresh setup and the updaters to the Rust host manager.
See [tooling/ci/README.md](tooling/ci/README.md) for the pipeline. The development, host and
release guides live outside Git at the workspace’s `docs/` directory.
